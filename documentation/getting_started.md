# Getting started testing the Physical Web

In order to get up and running you need two things:

1. A hardware beacon (or two)
2. Software on your phone/tablet to see that beacon.

To get a hardware beacon you have two choices. By far the easiest is to just buy a beacon that is ready made. [Blesh](https://www.blesh.com/physical-web/) sells packs of three that are easy to setup and use.

If you want to hack a bit, there is also a growing list of maker devices that support the broadcasting of URLs in [this directory](https://github.com/google/uribeacon/tree/master/beacons)

The software is the easiest thing to take care of. The app is on the [Google Play store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=physical_web.org.physicalweb) as well as the [Apple App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/physical-web/id927653608?mt=8).  A walkthrough of the app [is here](http://github.com/google/physical-web/blob/master/documentation/android_client_walkthrough.md) and will show you how to put your URL into a beacon.

Keep in mind that this software is just a prototype. We are doing it this way to easily and quickly test the concept. Eventually, the goal is to have this Physical Web code rolled into each browser.
